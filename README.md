# CP341

Committing a README.md that includes agreed-upon processes for the repository/group (e.g. how do we handle branching/merging, what directories are we going to have and what should be in them, what are expected work hours/communication modes/response times).

There should be a main branch with our most current project version. The development branch should have the most updated code, with all sub branches merging into development. From development, we will merge into main when we feel that it is at a stable enough point. We will use GitHub issues to manage next tasks and assign tasks to team members. We all agree on 8 hour weekdays and weekends when necessary. Work hours will change as needed based on team memberâ€™s schedules. We will use a text message group chat for communication, responding within an hour.
